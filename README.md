# Canyon

A programming language by Caleb Eden

## Purpose

The purpose of Canyon (or CanyonLang) is for me to learn more about the implementation of
Object Oriented Languages and Compilers outside of a school setting.

## Description

Canyon is an object oriented language that draws inspiration from Java, C#, C++,
and Python. It is a strongly typed, compiled language, where static types are attempted to
be inferred at compile-time, but also can be resolved at runtime by polymorphism.

## Current Objective(s)

- Determing the syntax to use to define CanyonLang
- Write a program to transpile to C and use gcc to convert to an executable

## Future Goals

- Create a set of builtin classes for Canyon
- Make some utility libraries in CanyonLang
- Write a dedicated compiler to machine code for CanyonLang
